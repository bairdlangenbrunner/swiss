This theme is adapted from Swiss, which itself was "inspired by Swiss design and the works of Massimo Vignelli."  I (Baird) think it's a beautiful theme to start from, and I wanted to edit it to include things like more advanced syntax highlighting and simpler page responses to media.

The primary reason I was attracted to this theme--and Jekyll/GitHub Pages more generally--is the fact that it allows for easy markdown-inspired blogging, code documentation, and research tangents all within the same document.

Something I've specifically added on top of the Swiss theme is syntax highlighting.  By default, this version comes with the Solarized Dark theme.  Some example code looks like this:

```python
# add python code here
a = 6
b = 7
def plus(a,b):
    return(a+b)
```

Notice there's specific syntax highlighting.  To create a block of code like this, you enclose it in three single quotation marks.  To make sure it recognizes Python syntax, you also must add Python to it:

	```python
	# add python code here
	a = 6
	b = 7
	def plus(a,b):
		return(a+b)
	```

If you aren't so into the syntax highlighting but still want to use big blocks of code, you can go without the ```python``` above, which looks like this:

```
# without "python" at top
# add python code here
a = 6
b = 7
def plus(a,b):
    return(a+b)
```

I'll update this with more information as I develop my personal websites.
